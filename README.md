# -Terraform-State-Commands-Lab
I learned how to inspect, query, modify, and manipulate Terraform state using the terraform state command family. I practiced listing resources, showing specific resource attributes, removing state entries, and renaming resources both in configuration and in the state file. I explored how remote state behaves differently from local state.
